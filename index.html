            Video games can also teach important skills or address serious issues, organizations such as Games For Change promote the use of games for education and social action, and often involve young people in the creation of games they can use to express themselves on important issues and current events. Some medical professionals, such as Doctor Kourosh Dini, also feel that “age appropriate multi-player video games can allow children to learn how other people think - a key aspect of empathy. Games can also help a child become more comfortable with new and ever progressing technology.” [1]

            Recent studies have shown that video games can have a positive or negative effect on how players behave, depending on the content. Pro-social games can increase empathy, co-operation, helping and emotional awareness, while violent games can diminish these traits. [2]

            Check out the Choosing Good Video Games tip sheet for help in finding great games for kids.
